	<h1>Group# 7 (Charlie)</h1>
	<h2>The test outcomes for each person in the team (all 3 tests), and your understanding of how this information may be helpful to the group. You should do this as soon as your group is formed. You will have a chance to reflect on how well the group has worked later.
	<p>This team of 6 young men presents a broad range of professional and life skills, as well as a good balance of personality types which should challenge and compliment each other.</p>

	<p>Two of our membership are clearly defined leaders, with natural capacity to guide and direct the other members. These roles are essential in any team, to ensure outcomes are achieved, deadlines are adhered to and challenges confronted and overcome. There is always potential for strong personalities to come into conflict, especially when authoritative hierarchies are not well defined, however due to the limited group size, and the collective drive to accomplish the task, this should not present as a major issue. </p>

	<p>Two more of our membership present as critical thinkers and problem solvers. These traits are well suited to the challenges associated with developing and later implementing a totally new idea. The ability to analyse proposed ideas critically and dispassionately, then break down the tasks required to complete the chosen idea and tackle them bodes well for the outcome. With support from the leadership centric members to maintain focus and accountability these members will be valuable contributors.</p>

	<p>One of our members brings creativity, style and passion that will compliment the more logical and analytical members of the team. If this member can bring their ideas and personality to the forefront, they will add nuance and the immeasurable spark required to take this beyond merely technically proficient. It will require compassion and sensitivity from the more outgoing members of the team to allow this personality type to fully engage in the task at hand.</p>

	<p>The final member identifies as a mediator. The ability to manage the challenges that invariably arise in any team, to support the more passive members in achieving their potential, to assist the leaders in communicating, and to refocus the technical personalities onto the important items will be invaluable.</p>

<p>The Results of the test just reiterate on what I already expected for myself.</p>
<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
<p>The results could influence a team by showing others what my personality and learning style is, so we could all work within our strongest points about ourselves. </p>
<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
<p> If a team of people all have different weakness and strong points it should work well as a whole group as we would be working at the most optimum point. </p>

			<h2>what do these results mean for you?
			<p>This means it takes me a while longer to process information and I need a clear explanation of the material presented. I would appreciate the feedback of my teammates and discussions</p>
<h2>How do they influence my behaviour in a team? </h2>
<p>As an introvert, when I am working with extroverts, it will give me the opportunity to come out of my shell and take part in the groups I work in. I would like to be able to express my thoughts and opinions, without being interrupted or talked over by my teammates and I would like to have some support. </p>

<h2>What do these results mean for you?</h2>

<p>The results of the above tests appear to be highly contradictory, with some comparable attributes positioned at opposite ends of the range depending on the specific test. Collectively, these results imply a personality with an aptitude for creativity and invention, and deficiencies in decisiveness.
From the perspective of a potential employer, the results suggest a personality well suited to positions where problem solving and product development are the primary focus. It is implied that I may not be a good fit for managerial or customer centric roles.
I have a preference to be involved in the detail of any project, which fits with my implied and actual strengths. Throughout my professional career, I have been part of a large variety of teams. I have a track record of successfully joining and contributing to existing teams, communicating, and collaborating with stakeholders effectively. I have demonstrated capacity for leadership when required, however this is not a position I am naturally inclined to seek out.</p>

 <h2> What do the test results mean to me?  </h2>
 <p>The results of the Auditory Leamer test was actually super surprising. I personally suspected for years I was better with reading and comprehending a large bulk of information. Especially with most of my personal childhood and teenhood spent reading. The other results on the otherhand arent super perplexing. I spent most of my life attempting to understand myself and my shortcomings to better enable me to better relate to those around me and I personally do hope that I continue my attempts to be self aware about myself.

<h2>How do they influence my behaviour in a team?</h2>

<p>The results personally might influence me to be better engaged in discussions from the get go. It might also change the way I approach dealing and communcating with others as I can tend to be more abbrasive and blind towards others general emotions and reactions to my actions.</p>

<h2> How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
<p>I should probably look for team members who are easy going and have an easier time gelling with more people who have stronger communication skills to make up for the personal skills I lack with others. I also personally would want to look for people who can take up more prominent leadership roles in a team as that tends to be something I tend to not enjoy doing myself inside group environments, or look for those that are capable of being independant workers themselves.</p>
