								<p>This team of 6 young men presents a broad range of professional and life skills, as well as a good balance of personality types which should challenge and compliment each other.</p>

<p>Two of our membership are clearly defined leaders, with natural capacity to guide and direct the other members. These roles are essential in any team, to ensure outcomes are achieved, deadlines are adhered to and challenges confronted and overcome. There is always potential for strong personalities to come into conflict, especially when authoritative hierarchies are not well defined, however due to the limited group size, and the collective drive to accomplish the task, this should not present as a major issue.</p>

<p>Two more of our membership present as critical thinkers and problem solvers. These traits are well suited to the challenges associated with developing and later implementing a totally new idea. The ability to analyse proposed ideas critically and dispassionately, then break down the tasks required to complete the chosen idea and tackle them bodes well for the outcome. With support from the leadership centric members to maintain focus and accountability these members will be valuable contributors.</p>

<p>One of our members brings creativity, style and passion that will compliment the more logical and analytical members of the team. If this member can bring their ideas and personality to the forefront, they will add nuance and the immeasurable spark required to take this beyond merely technically proficient. It will require compassion and sensitivity from the more outgoing members of the team to allow this personality type to fully engage in the task at hand.</p>

<p>The final member identifies as a mediator. The ability to manage the challenges that invariably arise in any team, to support the more passive members in achieving their potential, to assist the leaders in communicating, and to refocus the technical personalities onto the important items will be invaluable.</p>
